# BankAccountBoard
Add your bank accounts. Copy and share!

#Why

I do same jobs every when I need the my bank account number. Open the bank's app, login and copy or write somewhere (there is a still bank apps like that). This takes time while authenticate etc. 
Also sometimes I need a few account number in the same time. (It doesn't matter which bank is when I take money swh) 

So I developed an android app. Add your bank accounts and then you can copy whenever you want. You can share any platform. There are buttons for copy or share.

I used Realm as replacement for SQLite. Also used CardView, RecyclerView, ButterKnife Library and Pedant SweetAlert Library..
